# Medical_Insurance_Charges_Prediction_Using_KNN_Model

1) Problem Statement: 
Predict medical insurance charges based on features like age, BMI, smoking status, and other demographic information. This model helps estimate costs for individuals, assisting insurance companies in pricing policies accurately.

2) Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): 
Performed initial data analysis to understand distributions, identify missing values, and check correlations among features. Visualizations helped in understanding the relationships between features and charges.

3) Feature Engineering: 
Processed the data by encoding categorical variables, handling outliers, and applying scaling techniques to ensure all features are suitable for the KNN algorithm.

4) Feature Selection: 
Selected relevant features based on their correlation with the target variable (charges) and removed redundant or less impactful variables to improve model efficiency.

5) Model Training: 
Trained a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) regression model, experimenting with different values of k to find the optimal one. The model was trained and validated on the processed dataset.

6) Model Evaluation: 
Evaluated model performance using metrics like R2_Score & Adjusted R2 Score on both training and testing data. Fine-tuned parameters to balance accuracy and generalization. and I get accuracy R2_score of 0.83 for n_neighbors=6 from Testing Side.
